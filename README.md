## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + TypeScript
- [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) + Svelte Transition API
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about semantic HTML and accessibility since I have not really focused on them as much as I probably should. But hey, at least I know no accessibility is better than bad accessibility.
